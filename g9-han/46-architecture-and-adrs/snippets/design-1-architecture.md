## 1. Architecture

![Container diagram - Sports Venue Booking System](images/architecture.png)

The whole product runs as **one Python process** on one machine, with the database as a
file next to it. That is deliberate (see ADR 1 and ADR 3): the instructor must be able to
clone and run it in fifteen minutes on a machine we have never seen.

| Component | Technology | Where it runs | Responsibility |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Browser | Any modern browser | User's phone or laptop | Renders HTML pages and submits forms. No business logic. |
| Flask web app | Python 3.11+, Flask 3, Jinja2 templates - `src/app.py` | Host machine, port 5000 | Routes, form parsing, session cookie (BR8), role check before every owner/admin route (BR7, BR14), renders pages, serves the JSON API under `/api`. |
| Service layer | Plain Python modules - `src/auth.py`, `src/venues.py`, `src/booking.py`, `src/pricing.py` | Same process | Every business rule BR1-BR19 lives here, not in routes and not in templates. Routes call it; it calls the database. |
| SQLite database | SQLite 3 via the standard `sqlite3` module - `data/venues.db` | A file on the host | Stores the 7 tables of section 2. `CHECK` and `UNIQUE` constraints are the last line of defence for BR1, BR3, BR11, BR13, BR18. |
| Seed script | `src/init_db.py` + `data/venues.csv` | Run once by hand | Creates every table and inserts 24 venues, 6 users, 5 bookings. |
| Email service | SMTP (external) | Outside our system | Sends the verification link (BR4). **Sprint 2: a stub that prints the link to the console;** a real SMTP account is configured in Sprint 3 through `.env`. |

**What travels along each arrow**

| From → To | What travels |
|-----------|--------------|
| Browser → Flask | HTTP `GET` (page loads, search filters as query string) and `POST` (HTML form data, or JSON for `/api/*`) |
| Flask → Browser | Rendered HTML pages, JSON responses, the signed session cookie |
| Flask → Service layer | Python function calls with already-parsed input, e.g. `create_booking(user_id, venue_id, date, start_hour, hours)` |
| Service layer → Flask | A result object, or a `BusinessRuleError` carrying the BR number, message and HTTP code |
| Service layer → SQLite | SQL statements over `sqlite3`; every write that checks and then inserts runs in one transaction |
| Seed script → SQLite | `CREATE TABLE` from `src/schema.py`, then `INSERT` rows read from `data/venues.csv` |
| Service layer → Email service | An SMTP message containing the verification link (BR4) |

**Sprint 2 status.** Browser, Flask app, SQLite and seed script exist and are connected
(section 4). The service-layer modules are created one per story from Sprint 3; the only
query in the walking skeleton lives in `src/app.py` and moves to `src/venues.py` when
US03 is implemented.
