# G9_AI66A_SE - Sports Venue Booking System

A time-slot booking platform for amateur sports players in Hanoi: players see which pitch
is free at which hour and reserve it in minutes, instead of messaging venue owners one by
one and waiting for a reply; owners see the whole schedule of every venue they manage on
one screen instead of keeping it in a paper notebook.

## Definition of Done

A story is Done when **all** of the following are true. Not "mostly true". If one box is
unticked, the story stays in the sprint and is labelled `carried-over`.

| # | Criterion | Who checks |
|---|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Every acceptance criterion on the issue passes | Reviewer, by hand |
| 2 | The feature works from a clean clone with only the README steps | Reviewer |
| 3 | At least one automated test covers the new behaviour | CI |
| 4 | CI is green on the PR branch | CI |
| 5 | Code reviewed and approved by a teammate who did not write it | GitHub |
| 6 | Merged into `main` | GitHub |
| 7 | No secrets, `.env`, or database dumps in the diff | CI |
| 8 | `docs/traceability.md` updated if a screen or route changed | Reviewer |

## How we work in this repository

**One issue = one branch = one Pull Request.** Never combine two issues in one branch.

| Issue type | Branch pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Any issue (story, task, chore) | `<issue>-<short-english-slug>` | `44-database-schema-seed` |

Sprint 1 branches used `feature/` and `chore/` prefixes; from Sprint 2 the team follows
the course convention above.

- **Everything on GitHub is written in English**: issues, branch names, commit messages
  (subject and body), pull requests, review comments, code, comments and documentation
- Commits: `<type>: <summary>` with type `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor` or
  `chore`; 3-4 small commits per issue, committed on the day the work is done
- PR title: `[#<issue>] <short imperative summary>`
- PR body follows [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)
  and must contain the line `Closes #<number>` and an AI-assistance declaration
- A **different** teammate must press **Review changes → Approve** with at least one
  substantive comment - a question or a change request, not "ok"
- Never self-approve, and never merge your own PR before someone has reviewed it

## Setup

Sprint 1 was a requirements sprint - the repository currently holds documentation only,
no source code. Setup steps will be added in Sprint 2 once the stack is decided.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SE-FDA-NEU/G9_AI66A_SE.git
cd G9_AI66A_SE
```

Start with [`docs/requirements.md`](docs/requirements.md), then
[`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md).
